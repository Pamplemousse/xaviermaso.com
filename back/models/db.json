    "description": "We all seek to avoid the tunnel effect by shortening feedback loops. On that aspect, \"shifting left\" seems pertinent: integrate practices and tools that provide us with information about the state of security of our products as soon as possible, during development, so that one can act on what causes trouble before everything turns sour.\nWhat if security could be treated like any other quality effort? Or are we doomed to see the security of our applications only through audit reports?\n In this talk, I propose to take a look at a couple of tools and techniques that will help uncover security issues that may be hiding within your applications as you are working on them.",
